VIDEO TRANSCRIPT: Using Virtual Job Shadow for Career Research

In this step, we’ll talk about how to use Virtual Job Shadow to begin exploring the careers that 
interest you. 

If you’re not already logged in to Virtual Job Shadow, log in with your Davidson-Davie email address 
and the password you created.

Click on the Careers option at the top of the page, and select Career Central. From here, you can 
browse featured careers or search for a specific one that you’re interested in, based on your Holland 
Code interests.

Once you find a career you want to explore, click the video icon to watch a video profile of the 
career and learn more information about it. If a video profile is not yet available, a text icon 
appears. Click the career’s picture for a more detailed description of it, and then use the bulleted 
options in the pane on the left to see additional information, such as required education, earnings, 
future outlook, and more. 

If you like a career and want to save it, click Add to My Careers to favorite it. You can view all of 
your saved careers by clicking Careers at the top of the page and selecting My Careers.

Feel free to use Virtual Job Shadow to learn more about each of the careers in which you might be 
interested!
