VIDEO TRANSCRIPT: Virtual Job Shadow: Understanding Your Career Interest Profiler Results

In this video, we’ll talk about the results of the Interest Profiler. It’s divided into six interest 
areas. Each interest area has a description of the work activities that people who score high in 
that area often enjoy doing. 

The number to the right of each interest area indicates how high you scored in that area. The higher 
the score, the more interested you likely are in doing the activities in that interest area. 

The three areas you’d be most interested in appear at the top of this list, so for example, I scored 
the highest in Artistic, Conventional, and Social. The top three areas that appear for you on your 
results page will form your Holland Code. 

We’ll ask you a little later on to tell us more about your Holland Code, so it’s a good idea to 
write it down and have it handy! 

So, for example, my Holland Code is A for Artistic, C for Conventional, and S for Social. These are 
my dominant - or strongest - areas of interest, so I’ll write down ACS, and make sure I have it for 
later.

On the results page in Virtual Job Shadow, you can click on each interest area to look through the 
careers that match your interests, and if you’d like to save, download and/or print your Interest 
Profiler results, click the Download button at the bottom of the results page. 

OK! Remember to keep your Holland Code in mind, and in the next step, you’ll learn how to more 
closely match it with possible careers.
